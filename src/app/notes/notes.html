            <p>My true passion fired when I discovered more about myself, and that I love evolving, learning and
                improving. Previously unsatisfied with steady and monotounous job, I found coding, and it challenged
                me, and that's how it <span class="bold">hooked</span> me. It gave me the freedom to always find ways to
                be better. To always have
                a bigger scale to <span class="bold">climb</span>.
                I chose front-end because of my <span class="bold">creative</span> spirit, and visual way of learning. I love seeing
                how websites
                are becoming more and more captivating, outstanding and easy to use. And that inspires me of what I'm
                capable to build. But my <span class="bold">curiosity</span> for backend servers is also here, waiting for it's
                moment.
