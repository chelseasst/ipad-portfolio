        <p class="text">Worked 1 year and a half as a flight attendant, which gave me so much experiece about teamwork, good CRM,
            responsibility, time-managment. Taught me patience, self-control and adaptability. Definitely strengthens
            you as a person, and builds your work ethics. ✈️
          Simulaneously I was studying at SoftUni, and let's say my focus was there. The passion I had for programming was growing. And at one point I just committed to it. Now I enjoy building projects and learning new technologies and it's part of my daily life.
